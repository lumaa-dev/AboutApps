				<p>
					Apple recently introduced the
					<a
						href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-app-accessibility/overview-of-accessibility-nutrition-labels"
						>Accessibility Nutrition Labels</a
					>
					in the App Store for users to learn more about available accessibility
					features in apps like shown below. While this allows people with
					disabilities to choose better the apps they use, it is important to
					note that these labels are not a guarantee of accessibility.

			<p>
				All accessibility features displayed on Lumaa's apps are not guaranteed
				to be working, they may be incomplete or not fully functional. Reasons
				are that Apple automatically provides some of these features thanks to
				their frameworks and tools, and some features may not be available in all
				languages. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://support.apple.com/accessibility">Apple's website</a>.
